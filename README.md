# A dummy database *mini-mini* project

It is a dummy database for employee record tracking website.  
It is solely created for learning purpose as I am currently  
learning **PHP** and it is my first *mini-mini* project on **PHP**.

The database is created using **mySql** relational database and  
the UI/website is created using:
- HTML (Obviously)
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap framework

As I mentioned, it is a **PHP** project for learning, so the backend is  
created using **PHP** itself (did you expect me to use something else?! XD )
